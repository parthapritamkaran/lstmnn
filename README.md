 LSTM Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction
 
 •  Developed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model using Keras to predict a sinusoidal wave, achieving accurate 
    predictions with minimal training. Extended this model to financial data by predicting S&P 500 index price.
 •  Applied data normalization techniques to handle the stochastic nature of stock market data
 •  Conducted experiments, showing short-term predictions are accurate but, longer training reduces reliability.
 •  Analyzed model limitations and identified potential pitfalls in time series forecasting, emphasizing the importance of backtesting and 
    careful interpretation when applying machine learning models to real-world data.
